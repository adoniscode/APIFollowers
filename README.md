Ok, this is for the coding challenge.

You can generate a .jar file and run it, then can open a web browser and use the syntax:

/f/user_name

For example:

localhost:8080/f/puppy

and it will bring the followers of the user "puppy" and the followers of the followers, and the followers of the followers of the followers in JSON format.
What?!?!?!?!?!

Yeah, well, 3 levels down of followers (max 5 for each level).

-----

To get the repositories and stagazers use the syntax:

/r/user_name

For example:

localhost:8080/r/terminator

and it will bring the repos, and the guys stargazing the repos that "terminator" has. Once again, 3 levels in JSON format.


Also, you can just import the package or generate a .war file.

Thanks
